Designing a solution for the food crisis.
The goal for this texas state hackathon was to solve a solution for food insecure people; 
which don't have easy access to food.

# Problem
Design a system designed to alleviate food insecurity in our community.

Our solution we have came up with is a platform that aims to create a sustainable one line connection between food banks and urban community gardens available in our test areas.

VISION
**Vision**

By creating a streamlined platform, we envision connecting community gardens with food 
banks to better facilitate those in need. We hope to help the community have access to 
nutritious food at all time.

**Mssion**
Our mission at Patch is to create a platform that will allow users and suppliers to communicate efficiently and to create a strong presence of community gardens to help address hunger issues.

**Values**
 At Patch, we value our community and welcome any resources that are willing to help combat food insecurities. We believe technology can play a vital role to alleviate food insecurity as well as establishing a sense of unity within our platform and community.
